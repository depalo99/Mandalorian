After completing my mission I'm open to bounty hunting requests again. Hit me up to request the services of the best bounty hunter around.</p>

		<blockquote>
			<p>&ldquo;I had a great experience working with Mando. He was very professional. Even though that weird baby that was with him ate a couple of my rare eggs. Just the last of my species, no biggie. Besides that hiccup, Mando exceeded my expectations. I will definitely be using his services again in the future!&rdquo;</p>
